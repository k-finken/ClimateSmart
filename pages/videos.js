          <p className="mt-2 text-themeDark text-md">Never before in human history have we been richer, more advanced or powerful. And yet we feel overwhelmed in the face of rapid climate change. It seems simple on the surface. Greenhouse gases trap energy from the Sun and transfer it to our atmosphere. This leads to warmer winters, harsher summers. Dry places become drier and wet places wetter. Countless ecosystems will die while the rising oceans swallow coasts and the cities we build on them.</p>

          <p className="mt-2 text-themeDark text-md">Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have released over 1.5 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide or CO2 into the earths atmosphere.  In the year 2019  we were still pumping out  around 37 billion more.  Thats 50% more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And its not just CO2. Were also pumping out growing volumes  of  other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Combining all of our greenhouse gases, were emitting 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. 
And emissions keep rising but they need to get down to 0!</p>
